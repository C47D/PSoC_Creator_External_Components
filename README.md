# PSoC Creator External Components
I'm making this components for schematic clarity, hope you find it usefull.


To use the component follow this steps:

1.- Go to Component tag on the Workspace Explorer on your project.


2.- Right click on your current project and choose the option 'Import Component'.


3.- A dialog box will appear, choose the option 'import from archive' and search the path where you have the file located.
(You can choose a target project, this is usefull if you have more than one project on your wokspace).


4.- Click 'OK' and a new tab will appear on your Component Catalog window. You can define this tab when you are creating the external component symbol.
In this example i define the external component to be located on Community tab, External_Components Folder and it's named MPU6050.


5.- Use it, modify it if you like!!!


TODO: Find if it's possible to add external components as default dependency.
