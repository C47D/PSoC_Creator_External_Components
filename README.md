To add the external component to your project follow this steps:

1. Go to *Component* tag on the **Workspace Explorer** on your project.

3. A dialog box will appear, choose the option *'import from archive'* and search the path where you have the file (component.cycomp) located on your pc.
(You can choose a target project, this is usefull if you have more than one project on your wokspace).

4. Click *'OK'* and a new tab will appear on your **Component Catalog** window. You can define this tab when you are creating the external component symbol.
In this example i define the external component to be located on *Community tab*->*External_Components* folder and it's named *MPU6050*.

**TODO**: Find if it's possible to add external components as default dependency.
